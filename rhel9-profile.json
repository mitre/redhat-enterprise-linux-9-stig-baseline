The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.\n\nThis requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information system components that are, or use, such products. This can be verified by acceptance/validation processes in DoD or other government agencies.\n\nThere may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files in storage) that may be assessed on specific information system components.\n\nRestricting access to the kernel message buffer limits access to only root. This prevents attackers from gaining additional system information as a non-privileged user.\n\nThe sysctl --system command will load settings from all system configuration files. All configuration files are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name will take precedence. Files are read from directories in the following list from top to bottom.
