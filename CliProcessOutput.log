If the AD-SUPPORT subpolicy module is included (e.g., "FIPS:AD-SUPPORT"), and Active Directory support is not documented as an operational requirement with the information system security officer (ISSO), this is a finding.

If the NO-ENFORCE-EMS subpolicy module is included (e.g., "FIPS:NO-ENFORCE-EMS"), and not enforcing EMS is not documented as an operational requirement with the ISSO, this is a finding.

Verify the current minimum crypto-policy configuration with the following commands:
 
$ grep -E 'rsa_size|hash' /etc/crypto-policies/state/CURRENT.pol
hash = SHA2-256 SHA2-384 SHA2-512 SHA2-224 SHA3-256 SHA3-384 SHA3-512 SHAKE-256
min_rsa_size = 2048
 
If the "hash" values do not include at least the following FIPS 140-3 compliant algorithms  "SHA2-256 SHA2-384 SHA2-512 SHA2-224 SHA3-256 SHA3-384 SHA3-512 SHAKE-256", this is a finding.

If there are algorithms that include "SHA1" or a hash value less than "256" this is a finding.

If the "min_rsa_size" is not set to a value of at least 2048, this is a finding.
 
If these commands do not return any output, this is a finding.

The most important characteristic of a random number generator is its randomness, namely its ability to deliver random numbers that are impossible to predict. Entropy in computer security is associated with the unpredictability of a source of randomness.  The random source with high entropy tends to achieve a uniform distribution of random values. Random number generators are one of the most important building blocks of cryptosystems.

The rngd service feeds random data from hardware device to kernel random device. Quality (nonpredictable) random number generation is important for several security functions (i.e., ciphers).

init_on_free is a Linux kernel boot parameter that enhances security by initializing memory regions when they are freed, preventing data leakage. This process ensures that stale data in freed memory cannot be accessed by malicious programs.

SLUB canaries add a randomized value (canary) at the end of SLUB-allocated objects to detect memory corruption caused by buffer overflows or underflows. Redzoning adds padding (red zones) around SLUB-allocated objects to detect overflows or underflows by triggering a fault when adjacent memory is accessed. SLUB canaries are often more efficient and provide stronger detection against buffer overflows compared to redzoning. SLUB canaries are supported in hardened Linux kernels like the ones provided by Linux-hardened.

Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the risk of information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been released back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.

This requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information system components that are, or use, such products.

Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.

Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.

Terminating an unresponsive SSH session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.

Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.

RHEL 9 utilizes /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of "ClientAliveInterval" and "ClientAliveCountMax" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The "ClientAliveInterval" is a timeout interval in seconds, after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The "ClientAliveCountMax" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

3) All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations; and

Temporary accounts are privileged or nonprivileged accounts that are
    established during pressing circumstances, such as new software or hardware
    configuration or an incident response, where the need for prompt account
    activation requires bypassing normal account authorization procedures.

    If any inactive temporary accounts are left enabled on the system and are
    not either manually removed or automatically expired within 72 hours, the
    security posture of the system will be degraded and exposed to exploitation
    by unauthorized users or insider threat actors.

    Temporary accounts are different from emergency accounts. Emergency accounts,
    also known as "last resort" or "break glass" accounts, are local logon accounts
    enabled on the system for emergency use by authorized system administrators
    to manage a system when standard logon methods are failing or not available.

    Emergency accounts are not subject to manual removal or scheduled expiration
    requirements.

    The automatic expiration of temporary accounts may be extended as needed by
    the circumstances but it must not be extended indefinitely. A documented
    permanent account should be established for privileged users who need long-term
    maintenance accounts.

The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.

Associating event types with detected events in audit logs provides a means of investigating an attack, recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds, or identifying an improperly configured RHEL 9 system.

Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack. Ensuring the "auditd" service is active ensures audit records generated by the kernel are appropriately recorded.

Additionally, a properly configured audit subsystem ensures that actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they can be held accountable for their actions.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.

The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, audit reports) needed to successfully audit RHEL 9 system activity.

In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit system to potentially hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules back.  A system reboot would be noticeable, and a system administrator could then investigate the unauthorized changes.
