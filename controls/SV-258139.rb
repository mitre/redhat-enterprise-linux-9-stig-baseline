Extended attributes in file systems are used to contain arbitrary data and file metadata with security implications.'

If the "xattrs" rule is not being used on all uncommented selection lines in the "/etc/aide.conf" file, or extended attributes are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.'
