  title 'RHEL 9 must enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one lowercase character be used.'
  desc 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised. Requiring a minimum number of lowercase characters makes password guessing attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.'

Check the value for "lcredit" with the following command:

$ sudo grep lcredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf/*.conf

/etc/security/pwquality.conf:lcredit = -1

If the value of "lcredit" is a positive number or is commented out, this is a finding.'
