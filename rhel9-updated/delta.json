Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can be either hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.\n\nPoisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed pages, so any modification or reference to that page after being freed or before being initialized will be detected and prevented. This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance cost. Also prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory.\n\ninit_on_free is a Linux kernel boot parameter that enhances security by initializing memory regions when they are freed, preventing data leakage. This process ensures that stale data in freed memory cannot be accessed by malicious programs.\n\nSLUB canaries add a randomized value (canary) at the end of SLUB-allocated objects to detect memory corruption caused by buffer overflows or underflows. Redzoning adds padding (red zones) around SLUB-allocated objects to detect overflows or underflows by triggering a fault when adjacent memory is accessed. SLUB canaries are often more efficient and provide stronger detection against buffer overflows compared to redzoning.

Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and \"unset\" in the same way.\n\nThe system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.\n\n",

Virtual system calls map into user space a page that contains some variables and the implementation of some system calls. This allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate the context switching expense.\n\nVirtual system calls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has control of the return instruction pointer. Disabling virtual system calls help to prevent return oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns.
